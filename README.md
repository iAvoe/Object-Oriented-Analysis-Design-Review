## System development

A project to develop a new information system

### Project

A planned undertaking / endeavor that has a beginning and end, and produces end results

### System development life cycle (SDLC)

To better manage a project by making things / activities clear and consistent.

The 6 SDLC Core processes:

1. **Identify** the problem or need
2. **Plan** and monitor the project
  - what to do, how to do & who does rest of core processes
3. **Analyze** and discover the details of problem or need
4. **Design** the system components
5. **Build / Development**, test and integrate components
6. **Deployment** the solution
  - Maintenance may be included

### Project Team

- Head: Project Manager
- Center: Quality Analyst
- Left-Right: Business Analyst & System Analyst
- Bottom: Designer & Developer

A system analyst is the architect captures the vision, understands the need for a new system

### System Vision Document (SVD)

Within the 1st core process. To identify the benefits to the company and the functional capabilities that will be included in the system. The project team first reviews the System Vision Document, verifies that the preliminary work is still valid.

### Approval of the project

Within the 1st core process. Some organizations have a formal process, some aren't

### Work breakdown structure (WBS)

Within the 2nd core process. Defines what todo, how to do, & who does the rest of core processes

## Development Types

### Agile / Spiral

Neither team members nor the users completely understand the problems and complexities, therefore:
- The team must be responsive to unanticipated issues. The plan must be agile and flexible
- The plan must be flexible on changes and new requirements that come up during the development
- The 6 core processes are carried out iteratively, therefore its also called spiral
- Effective for GUI and web solutions
- Useful when constantly making small changes
- Testing is not delayed

### Iterative

A project consists of many mini-projects, with each core components follow their own 6 core processes.
- An iteration lasts a fixed period of time, usually two to four weeks
- Iterative is a process-oriented approach that emphasizes repetition and refinement
- In contrast, Agile is a customer-focused approach that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration

#### 5 core processes in every iteration:
- **Step 1 - Planning & Requirements:** In this stage, map out the initial requirements, gather the related documents, and create a plan and timeline for the first iterative cycle
- **Step 2 - Analysis & Design:** Finalize the business needs, database models, and technical requirements based on the plan. Create a working architecture, schematic, or algorithm that satisfies your requirements
- **Step 3 - Implementation:** Develop the functionality and design required to meet the specifications
- **Step 4 - Testing:** Identify and locate what’s not working or performing to expectations
- **Step 5 - Evaluation & Review:** Compare this iteration with the requirements and expectations

### Waterfall / V-Model

The 6 core processes are carried out one by one with no going back, therefore:
- Each step must be completed prefectly
- Works well for centralized processing applications and procedural languages
- Uses Data Flow Diagrams & Entity Relationship Diagrams
- Testing is delayed
